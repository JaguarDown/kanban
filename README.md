Personal version of Jira using the Kanban idea

## Getting Started
### Branch Conventions
Do work on local dev branches and submit pull request to master. More branch conventions may be added later if needed.

### Version number convention
Semantic version number convention: Major.minor.patch.
Major = A release with all proposed features implemented.
Minor = Feature added.
Patch = Bug fix.
